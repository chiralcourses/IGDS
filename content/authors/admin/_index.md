[Genomic Data Science Center](https://github.com/gdscbd) is a research wing of the [CHIRAL Bangladesh](https://www.chiralbd.org/). The wing focuses on using publicly available genomic data to understand the cause of diseases, the transmission of conditions, and the evolutionary relationship among multiple organisms. The GDSC team also uses genomic epidemiology to understand the community transmission of viruses such as COVID-19, Dengue, and Chikungunya.

This course will give students a foundation in genomic research principles and practice, mainly applied to public health. In addition, we will have weekly lectures covering various topics, including research methodology, data collection methods, statistics, R programming, data visualization(human perception, color theory, principles of visual design), etc.

We will also have weekly hands-on laboratory sessions in which students will have the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.
