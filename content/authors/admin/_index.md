<br>

This course will give students a foundation in research principles and practice, mainly applied to public health. In addition, we will have weekly lectures covering various topics, including research methodology, data collection methods, statistics, R programming, data visualization(human perception, color theory, principles of visual design), etc.

We will also have weekly hands-on laboratory sessions in which students will have the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.
